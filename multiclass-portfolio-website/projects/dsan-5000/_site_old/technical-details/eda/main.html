<p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial beginning step in any data science project. On this page, I will examine distributions, analyze correlations, and uncover relationships between variables, ensuring the data is ready for the modeling phase. These insights will guide and shape our modeling approach. It is important to avoid modeling blindly and instead base our decisions on a thorough understanding of the data.</p>

<p>It looks like there are some high correlations, specifically some data that is perfectly multicollinear. For example â€˜Percent Femaleâ€™ and â€˜Percent Maleâ€™ is nearly perfectly negatively correlated and â€˜Student Percent - Black and Hispanicâ€™ and â€˜Student Percent - Otherâ€™ is perfectly negatively correlated since there are only two population groups.This will have to be removed for modeling.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The EDA process has provided us with valuable insights into the data, which will guide and shape the modeling process. By examining distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables, potential issues have been identified such as skewness and multicollinearity, which help identify transformations and feature engineering necessary. For example, I applied log transformations to variables exhibiting power law distributions, resulted in more normally distributed data, a key assumption for regression analysis.</p>
<p>I also identified significant relationships between several variables and our target metrics. T-tests showed significant differences in median household income between schools with high and low dropout rates, as well as significant differences in supportive school environment scores between schools with high and low chronic absenteeism. Similarly, the ANOVA test revealed that the there is a significant difference in Economic Need Index for schools with different levels of college persistence. These findings all highlighting the importance of addressing socioeconomic and school quality factors to improve student outcomes.</p>
<p>Geographic analysis further identified areas where intervention may be necessary, such as high dropout rates in the Bronx and high chronic absenteeism in district 84.</p>

<section id="next-steps" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data Preprocessing for Modeling: Apply transformations and drop multicollinear features that were identified using correlation heatmap.</li>
<li>Modeling: Develop regression models to predict chronic absenteeism and classification models to identify schools with high dropout rate and low college persistence rates.</li>
<li>Investigate additional transformations or feature engineering that can improve model performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings highlight the necessity to design targeted interventions in districts with high dropout rates or chronic absenteeism, focusing on socioeconomic factors and school environment. The goal is to build predictive models that can help inform these interventions to improve high school outcomes in New York City.</p>
