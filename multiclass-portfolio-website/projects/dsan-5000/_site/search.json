    "text": "High school dropout rates have a profound impact on students, families, and communities. To bring these numbers down, it’s essential to first understand what’s driving them. This study takes a closer look at how the quality of schools and the socioeconomic challenges students face influence high school outcomes in New York City. By diving into these factors, the goal is to uncover ways to help students succeed.\n\n\n\nHow does a school’s environment contribute to better student outcomes?\nWhat are the most significant predictors of student absenteeism, dropout rates and college persistence?\nWhat are the interactions between chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence?\nHow does socioeconomic status impact student absenteeism, dropout rates and college persistence?\nHow can early academic indicators be used to identify schools at risk of high dropout or not persisting in college?\n\n\n\n\n\nCollect and clean data, creating a comprehensive dataset of NYC high schools\nPerform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends in the data\nPerform unsupervised learning and supervised learning to find real relationships between the features and targets: chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence\nSummarize findings into actionable insights\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset contains 500 New York City public high schools. We can begin by taking a look at dropout rates across New York City Boroughs, revealing areas of needed intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Boroughs of New York City\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Boxplot of dropout rates by NYC Borough\n\n\n\n\nIt is evident that the highest median drop out rate is in the Bronx, followed by Brooklyn. Although there are some high outliers in Queens. This highlights boroughs where intervention is necessary. To take a closer look, we can look at drop out rates by specific NYC school districts.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Boxplot of dropout rates by NYC DOE Districts\n\n\n\nThis plot clearly shows the highest drop out rate to be in district 12, which is located in the Bronx. Next is district 8 which is also located in the Bronx. This plot makes it easier to pinpoint school districts that need to be targeted.\nNext, we will examine specific socioeconomic and school features that are hypothesized to impact our target outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Scatter plot of median household income by dropout rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Scatter plot of chronic absenteeism vs school environment\n\n\n\n\nUsing statistical testing, it was concluded that there is a statistically significant difference in mean median household income between high schools with high dropout rates and those with low dropout rates. This suggests that students from higher income households, likely with parents who have degrees and employment, are less likely to drop out themselves. This emphasizes the importance of addressing economic disparities to improve these rates.\nSupportive Environment score comes from the NYC Quality report and is defined as, “how well the school establishes a culture where students feel safe, challenged to grow, and supported to meet high expectations”1. There is a statistically significant difference in the mean supportive environment score for a school with high and low rates of chronic absenteeism. This is important because it shows that when students feel good about the school environment, and feel a sense of value and community, they are less likely to skip class or be absent.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Scatter plot of college persistence vs average grade 8 proficiency\n\n\n\nFigure 6 highlights a strong relationship between college persistence and average grade 8 proficiency, emphasizing the critical need for early intervention. Students who perform well in 8th grade are more likely to succeed in college and persist through their studies. This highlights the importance of addressing academic gaps during middle school, before they affect long-term outcomes in order to set students up for success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: PCA results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: t-SNE results\n\n\n\n\nPCA was applied to the socioeconomic factors, revealing a pattern in Figure 7 where schools with higher dropout rates are positioned towards the top of the plot, while those with lower dropout rates are found towards the bottom. This illustrates the significant impact of socioeconomic factors on dropout rates.\nT-SNE was able to uncover certain patterns in the data and differentiate schools with varying levels of college persistence in Figure 8. While there is some overlap, the gradient becomes lighter as it moves to the right. This emphasizes the model’s ability to distinguish schools based on their college persistence levels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Agglomerative clustering results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Boxplot of agglomerative clusters vs targets\n\n\nAgglomerative Clustering worked best for this data, and was able to find patterns in the data. Looking at the boxplot in Figure 9, it is clear that Cluster 1 contains schools with the best student outcomes: low chronic absenteeism, low dropout rates, and high college persistence. This indicates that the algorithm successfully identified meaningful patterns in the data, emphasizing the role these features play in evaluating high school outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget: Chronic Absenteeism\n\n\n\nFigure 11: LASSO regression feature importance\n\n\nThe LASSO regression gave the features most important to our target, chronic absenteeism. Supportive Environment score emerging as the most important variable in our model. This score reflects how well a school fosters a supportive, challenging environment for students1. The next key feature was Average Grade 8 Proficiency. This metric emphasizes how important it is for children to be on the right track from a young age. The third important factor was Rigorous Instruction score, which measures how engaging and effective the curriculum is in promoting critical-thinking skills1. Additionally, significant socioeconomic factors contributing to chronic absenteeism included Percent English Language Learners and Percent in Temporary Housing.\n\n\n\nTarget: Classifying Schools with High vs. Low Dropout Risk\n\n\n\nMetric\nClass 0\nClass 1\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\nPrecision\n0.97\n0.69\n\n\n\nRecall\n0.89\n0.91\n\n\n\nF1-Score\n0.93\n0.78\n0.89\n\n\n\nBased on the recall score, the gradient boosting model successfully identified high-risk dropout schools 91% of the time. These results suggest that the model can accurately predict schools at high risk of dropout, enabling targeted interventions to address key factors contributing to dropout risk.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Gradient boosting classification feature importancegb\n\n\nThe top 15 important features highlight several key factors, with college persistence ranking the highest. This suggests that schools struggling with dropout risk may also have issues with retaining students after their first year of college. Other significant features include the percentage of students in temporary housing and the percentage of overage/undercredited students (students with very few credits), which indicates a strong relationship between socioeconomic challenges and dropout rates.\n\n\n\nTarget: Classifying Schools with High vs. Medium vs. Low College Persistence\n\n\n\nMetric\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nAccuracy\n\n\n\n\nPrecision\n0.60\n0.67\n0.92\n\n\n\nRecall\n0.86\n0.91\n0.72\n\n\n\nF1-Score\n0.71\n0.77\n0.81\n0.78\n\n\n\nExamining the recall scores, this gradient boosting multiclass classification model successfully predicts 86% of schools with high college persistence, 72% of schools with medium college persistence, and 91% of schools with low college persistence. While there is room for improvement in predicting the medium category, the model’s ability to accurately identify schools with low college persistence is particularly significant, as this is where intervention is most needed.\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Gradient boosting classification feature importancegb\n\n\nLooking at the feature importance, similar to what was seen in the regression model for chronic absenteeism, Average Grade 8 Proficiency is the most important driver of college persistence. It is interesting that this metric continues to have predictive power at the college level. Additionally, both dropout rate and the percentage of chronically absent students are significant features in this model, highlighting the interconnectedness of these metrics within schools that must be addressed.\n\n\n\n\nGrade 8 Proficiency is a crucial indicator of future success, highlighting the importance of early intervention to address academic challenges before they escalate\nSupportive and Trusting Environments contribute to better student outcomes, emphasizing the need for schools to create cultures where students feel safe, supported, and motivated\nEconomic Disadvantage plays a significant role in long-term outcomes such as college persistence, with students from lower-income backgrounds facing more barriers to succes\nThe Connection: Chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence are closely linked. Addressing absenteeism early is key to preventing dropout and ensuring students stay on track for college success.\n\nBy identifying and understanding the key drivers, such as school environment and socioeconomic factors, targeted strategies can be developed to support students more effectively. Empowering schools to create safe, supportive, and inclusive environments, while addressing broader economic challenges, is essential to ensure that every student has the opportunity to succeed academically and beyond."

In this task, there is one variable of interest, referred to as the dependent variable, and several independent features, which is hypothesized to be related to the dependent variable. The strength of these relationships is quantified by the coefficients of the independent variables.\nIn this case, our goal is to identify the drivers of chronic absenteeism. By analyzing these outputs, schools can implement targeted interventions to reduce chronic absenteeism in New York City Public Schools.\nTarget Variable: Percent of Students Chronically Absent\n\nLASSO Regression\nLASSO, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator is a regularization technique known as L1 Regularization. It is a good option in this case because of its ability to work with high dimensional data. One can think of it like a rope lasso that is thrown around all the features and filters out the variables that do not contribute to our model, by pushing their coefficients to 0. It does this by introducing a regularization hyperparamter, which will be tuned to help shrink the coefficicents. This will help us perform feature selection automatically, and find the importance of the terms that are left.\n\n\nCode\nX, y, X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocessing(df = df_clean, target_column='Percent of Students Chronically Absent')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_train, y_train, 'regression', 'lasso_regression', alpha=0.01)\ny_pred = validation_eval('regression', model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.1010\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1250\nR-squared: 0.3138\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.scatter(y_val, y_pred)\nplt.plot([min(y_val), max(y_val)], [min(y_pred), max(y_pred)], color='red', linestyle='--') \nplt.xlabel(\"True Values\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Predicted Values\")\nplt.title(\"Parity Plot\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo tune the hyperparamter, I will use scikit-learn’s cross validation tool specifically for Lasso regression, LassoCV to find the optimal choice for alpha\n\n\nCode\nlasso_cv = LassoCV(alphas=[0.1, 0.01, 0.05, 0.001, 0.005, 0.0005, 0.0001], cv=5)\nlasso_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint(f\"Optimal alpha: {lasso_cv.alpha_}\")\n\n\nOptimal alpha: 0.005\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_train, y_train, 'regression', 'lasso_regression', alpha=0.001)\ny_pred = evaluate_test('regression', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0829\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1053\nR-squared: 0.6077\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)\nplt.plot([min(y_test), max(y_test)], [min(y_pred), max(y_pred)], color='red', linestyle='--') \nplt.xlabel(\"True Values\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Predicted Values\")\nplt.title(\"Parity Plot\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, using the absolute value of the coefficients, we can visualize the features that are most relevant to the target variable\n\n\nCode\nfeature_names = X.columns\ncoefs = model.coef_\n\ncoefs_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': feature_names, 'Coefficient': coefs})\n\n\ncoefs_df['abs_val_coef'] = coefs_df['Coefficient'].abs()\ncoefs_df = coefs_df.sort_values(by='abs_val_coef', ascending=False)\n\ncoefs_df = coefs_df.loc[coefs_df['abs_val_coef']&gt;0]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))\ncoefs_df.plot(kind='barh', x='Feature', y='abs_val_coef', legend=False)\nplt.xlabel('Absolute Value of Coefficient')\nplt.title('Feature Importance Based on Lasso Regression')\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 2000x1500 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: After tuning the alpha of the model, the fit improved to 61%, with a decrease in RMSE and MAE. In addition, valuable insights can be gained from the Feature Importance graph, with Supportive Environment score emerging as the most important variable in our model. This score reflects how well a school fosters a supportive, challenging environment for students1. The next most important feature is Average Grade 8 Proficiency. This metric emphasizes how important it is for children to be on the right track from a young age. The third key factor was Rigorous Instruction score, which reflects how engaging the curriculum and how effectively it promotes critial-thinking skills1. Additionally, significant socioeconomic factors contributing to chronic absenteeism included Percent English Language Learners and Percent in Temporary Housing.\n\n\nRandom Forest Regression\nRandom Forest is a supervised learning task that is an ensemble of many decision trees. Simply, decision trees work by starting at a root node and split depending on questions asked at each successive node. Random Forest is just many decision trees working together. It is superior to single decision trees because it prevents overfitting by averaging the outcome of the individual trees to get the final result. In addition, it is less sensitive to multicollinearity and normalization than other regression methods and can learn non-linear boundaries.\nThere are a few important hyperparamters to tune in random forest regression. This includes n_estimators (the number of trees in the forest), max_depth (the maximum depth or number of splits each tree can have), max_features (how many features are considered for splits), and bootstrap (whether bootstrapping (resampling with replacement) should be used)2\nWhen bootstrapping is used, this is considered a bagging method (Bootstrap Aggregating).\nI will apply the Random Forest Regressor and evaluate whether it improves our results.\n\n\nCode\nX, y, X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocessing(df_regression, 'Percent of Students Chronically Absent')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_train, y_train, 'regression', 'random_forest')\nprint('Validation Scores')\ny_pred = validation_eval('regression',model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\nValidation Scores\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0860\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1136\nR-squared: 0.5295\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.scatter(y_val, y_pred)\nplt.plot([min(y_val), max(y_val)], [min(y_pred), max(y_pred)], color='red', linestyle='--') \nplt.xlabel(\"True Values\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Predicted Values\")\nplt.title(\"Parity Plot\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTune and Retrain Model\n\n\nCode\ntune(model, X_train, y_train, rf_param_grid, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')\n\n\nBest params: {'bootstrap': True, 'max_depth': 15, 'max_features': 'log2', 'n_estimators': 200}\n\n\nRandomForestRegressor(max_depth=15, max_features='log2', n_estimators=200)In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

Now it is evident which features are most important to our target variable.\n\n\nCode\nfeature_importances = model.feature_importances_\nfeature_names = X.columns\n\nimportance_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': feature_names, 'Importance': feature_importances}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nimportance_df.plot(kind='barh', x='Feature', y='Importance', legend=False)\nplt.xlabel('Importance')\nplt.title('Feature Importance Based on Random Forest Regression')\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 1000x600 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults: Our tuned Random Forest model performed slightly better than the original but did not outperform the LASSO regression. Nonetheless, I can still evaluate the feature importance from the Random Forest and compare it to previous models. Average Grade 8 Proficiency and Supportive Environment scores remain in the top 3 most important features. Additionally, ‘Percent College Ready based on SAT Math’ has emerged as a key feature. This suggests that SAT Math scores are an indicator of chronic absenteeism—students who attend school regularly are more likely to be college-ready based on their SAT performance.\n\n\nGradient Boosting Regression\nI will try one more regression algorithm to see if it can improve our results.\nUnlike the previous bagging method, I will now employ a boosting technique. In boosting, trees are grown sequentially rather than in parallel, as in bagging. This approach uses random sampling with replacement over weighted data, enabling each tree to learn from the errors of the previous models. By aggregating these weak learners into a strong learner, boosting optimizes the overall model performance.\nThe important hyperparameters to tune in gradient boosting are learning rate (controls for the contribution of each tree), n_estimators (number of trees), max_depth (controls number of nodes in the tree), and max_features (number of features to consider for splits)3\n\n\nCode\nX, y, X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocessing(df_regression, 'Percent of Students Chronically Absent')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_train, y_train, 'regression', 'gradient_boosting')\ny_pred = validation_eval('regression', model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0781\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.0967\nR-squared: 0.5203\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.scatter(y_val, y_pred)\nplt.plot([min(y_val), max(y_val)], [min(y_pred), max(y_pred)], color='red', linestyle='--') \nplt.xlabel(\"True Values\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Predicted Values\")\nplt.title(\"Parity Plot\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = tune(model, X_train, y_train, boost_param_grid, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')\n\n\nBest params: {'learning_rate': 0.05, 'max_depth': 10, 'max_features': 'log2', 'n_estimators': 100}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_train, y_train, 'regression', 'gradient_boosting', learning_rate= 0.05, max_depth= 10, max_features= 'log2', n_estimators= 100)\nprint('Validation Scores')\ny_pred = validation_eval('regression', model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\nValidation Scores\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0742\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.0941\nR-squared: 0.5461\n\n\n\n\nCode\nprint('Test Evaluation')\ny_pred = evaluate_test('regression', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nTest Evaluation\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0978\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.1209\nR-squared: 0.5147\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)\nplt.plot([min(y_test), max(y_test)], [min(y_pred), max(y_pred)], color='red', linestyle='--') \nplt.xlabel(\"True Values\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Predicted Values\")\nplt.title(\"Parity Plot\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: The tuned gradient boosting model shows slight improvement over the original but does not perform as well on the test data. Both the LASSO and Random Forest Regression models outperformed it, suggesting that gradient boosting may not be the best fit for this dataset."

    "text": "Binary Classification\nBinary classification is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting categorical variables with two possible classes. The goal is to train a model that accurately predicts the correct class labels as much as possible. The output of a classification task is best evaluated using a confusion matrix, which provides insights into the model’s performance. From the confusion matrix, one can calculate key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The choice of the metric to maximize depends on the specific classification problem.\nThe calculations are as follows: \\[\n\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\n\\] \\[\n\\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n\\] \\[\n\\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n\\] F1 is the harmonic balance of precision and recall, calculated as: \\[\n\\text{F1} = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n\\]\nTarget variable: High Schools with high vs. low dropout risk\nIn this case, accuracy is not an ideal metric because our classes are imbalanced. The worst-case scenario is failing to identify a school as having high dropout risk. If “high schools with high dropout risk” is treated as the positive class as, the aim is to minimize false negatives (Type II errors) and maximize the recall score. To achieve this, cross-validation will be used to identify the algorithm that performs best for our objective.\nFirst, I will create a binary variable for high dropout risk. High-risk schools will be defined as those in the 75th percentile or above of the dropout rate distribution. Additionally, I will exclude the “Graduation Rate” feature to avoid data leakage.\n\n\nCode\nprint(df_clean['dropout_rate'].describe())\n\n\ncount    501.000000\nmean       0.053580\nstd        0.052614\nmin        0.000000\n25%        0.012250\n50%        0.037000\n75%        0.077000\nmax        0.276500\nName: dropout_rate, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_class = df_clean.copy()\ndf_class['high_dropout'] = [1 if x &gt;= .077 else 0 for x in df_class['dropout_rate']]\ndf_class.drop(['dropout_rate','Graduation Rate'], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Classification\nI will begin by using a Random Forest classifier. This method is similar to the Random Forest regressor explored earlier, but instead of predicting continuous variables, the trees now predict the class to which the data belongs. In Random Forest classification, the final prediction is determined by a majority vote among all the decision trees in the ensemble, rather than taking the average as in regression.\nSince our minorty class is imbalanced I will use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to over sample the minority class. This will balance the data and create a more robust model.\n\n\nCode\nX, y, X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocessing(df = df_class, target_column='high_dropout')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsmote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto')\nX_smote, y_smote = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_smote, y_smote, 'classification', 'random_forest')\ny_pred = validation_eval('classification',model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny_pred = evaluate_test('classification', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nClassification Report:               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.91      0.83      0.87        75\n           1       0.61      0.77      0.68        26\n\n    accuracy                           0.81       101\n   macro avg       0.76      0.80      0.77       101\nweighted avg       0.83      0.81      0.82       101\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = tune(model, X_train, y_train, rf_param_grid, scoring='f1')\n\n\nBest params: {'bootstrap': False, 'max_depth': 15, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'n_estimators': 50}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_smote, y_smote, 'classification', 'random_forest', bootstrap=False, max_depth=15, max_features='sqrt', n_estimators=50)\ny_pred = validation_eval('classification', model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny_pred = evaluate_test('classification', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nClassification Report:               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.89      0.88      0.89        75\n           1       0.67      0.69      0.68        26\n\n    accuracy                           0.83       101\n   macro avg       0.78      0.79      0.78       101\nweighted avg       0.83      0.83      0.83       101\n\n\n\nResult: The tuned Random Forest Classifier showed only a slight improvement upon the base model. Since it is necessary to prioritize recall, to avoid overlooking schools with high dropout risk, this model correctly identifies 88% of schools with low dropout risk but only 69% of schools with high dropout risk. This suggests that there is room for improvement. Next, I will explore alternative classification algorithms to achieve better recall for high-risk schools.\n\n\nGradient Boosting Classification\nNext, I will use a Gradient Boosting Classifier. This method is similar to the Gradient Boosting Regressor tried earlier, but instead of predicting continuous values, the trees are trained to classify the data into predefined classes.\n\n\nCode\nX, y, X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocessing(df = df_class, target_column='high_dropout')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsmote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto')\nX_smote, y_smote = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_smote, y_smote, 'classification', 'gradient_boosting')\ny_pred = validation_eval('classification',model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny_pred = evaluate_test('classification', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nClassification Report:               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.96      0.89      0.92        79\n           1       0.68      0.86      0.76        22\n\n    accuracy                           0.88       101\n   macro avg       0.82      0.87      0.84       101\nweighted avg       0.90      0.88      0.89       101\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = tune(model, X_train, y_train, boost_param_grid, scoring='f1')\n\n\nBest params: {'learning_rate': 0.2, 'max_depth': 3, 'max_features': 'log2', 'n_estimators': 100}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_smote, y_smote, 'classification', 'gradient_boosting', learning_rate =0.2, max_depth=3, max_features='log2', n_estimators=100)\ny_pred = validation_eval('classification', model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny_pred = evaluate_test('classification', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nClassification Report:               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.97      0.89      0.93        79\n           1       0.69      0.91      0.78        22\n\n    accuracy                           0.89       101\n   macro avg       0.83      0.90      0.86       101\nweighted avg       0.91      0.89      0.90       101\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfeature_importances = model.feature_importances_\nfeature_names = X.columns\n\nimportance_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': feature_names, 'Importance': feature_importances}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False).head(15)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nimportance_df.plot(kind='barh', x='Feature', y='Importance', legend=False)\nplt.xlabel('Importance')\nplt.title('Top 15 Features')\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 1000x600 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult: The tuned gradient boosting model effectively predicts high and low dropout risk for high schools, outperforming the Random Forest model. Since recall is prioritized (to avoid overlooking schools with high dropout risk), this model performs well, correctly identifying 89% of schools with low dropout risk and 91% of schools with high dropout risk. These results suggest that it is possible to identify key drivers of dropout risk and intervene accordingly.\nThe top 15 important features highlight several key factors, with college persistence ranking the highest. This suggests that schools struggling with dropout risk may also have issues with retaining students after their first year of college. Other significant features include percent of students in temporary housing and percent of overage/undercredited students (students with very few credits), which indicates a strong relationship between socioeconomic challenges and dropout rates."

In this case, the interest is classifying high schools based on their rates of college persistence, which will be categorized as low, medium, or high.\nIn our binary classification, the focus was identifying high schools with a high dropout risk rate. However, even if a high school is deemed “safe” with low dropout risk, it is still necessary to intervene if the school has low college persistence rates. While preventing high school dropout is a significant achievement, it is also important to translate efforts into preventing dropouts from higher education.\nTarget Variable: College Persistence\nFirst, I will divide the college persistence distribution into three bins, labeling them as Low, Medium, and High. I will again use SMOTE to address class imbalance.\n\n\nCode\ndf_multi = df_clean.copy()\ndf_multi['college_persistence_ranking'] = pd.cut(df_multi['Metric Value - College Persistence'], bins=3, labels=['Low','Medium','High'])\ndf_multi.drop(['Metric Value - College Persistence'], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n\n\nRandom Forest Classifier\nI will test how well a Random Forest Classifier predicts our labels, this time for three classes\n\n\nCode\nX, y, X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocessing(df = df_multi, target_column='college_persistence_ranking')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsmote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto')\nX_smote, y_smote = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_smote, y_smote, 'classification', 'random_forest')\ny_pred = validation_eval('classification',model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny_pred = evaluate_test('classification', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nClassification Report:               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n        High       0.63      0.77      0.69        22\n         Low       0.61      0.64      0.62        22\n      Medium       0.75      0.67      0.70        57\n\n    accuracy                           0.68       101\n   macro avg       0.66      0.69      0.67       101\nweighted avg       0.69      0.68      0.68       101\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = tune(model, X_train, y_train, rf_param_grid)\n\n\nBest params: {'bootstrap': True, 'max_depth': 5, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'n_estimators': 50}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_smote, y_smote, 'classification', 'random_forest', bootstrap=True, max_depth=5, max_features='sqrt', n_estimators=50)\ny_pred = validation_eval('classification', model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny_pred = evaluate_test('classification', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nClassification Report:               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n        High       0.64      0.82      0.72        22\n         Low       0.66      0.86      0.75        22\n      Medium       0.84      0.65      0.73        57\n\n    accuracy                           0.73       101\n   macro avg       0.71      0.78      0.73       101\nweighted avg       0.76      0.73      0.73       101\n\n\n\nResult: The tuned Random Forest Classifier showed a slight improvement upon the base model in predicting instances of high and low rates of college persistence but performed worse for schools with medium rates, identifying only 65% of them. I hypothesize that similar to binary classification, the gradient boosted will improve upon this performance.\n\n\nGradient Boosting\nNow I will attempt a Gradient Boosting Classifier and see if it improves upon the Random Forest Classifier\n\n\nCode\nX, y, X_train, X_val, X_test, y_train, y_val, y_test = preprocessing(df = df_multi, target_column='college_persistence_ranking')\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsmote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto')\nX_smote, y_smote = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_smote, y_smote, 'classification', 'gradient_boosting')\ny_pred = validation_eval('classification',model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny_pred = evaluate_test('classification', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nClassification Report:               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n        High       0.55      0.86      0.67        14\n         Low       0.61      0.86      0.72        22\n      Medium       0.90      0.66      0.76        65\n\n    accuracy                           0.73       101\n   macro avg       0.68      0.79      0.71       101\nweighted avg       0.79      0.73      0.74       101\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = tune(model, X_train, y_train, boost_param_grid)\n\n\nBest params: {'learning_rate': 0.05, 'max_depth': 3, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'n_estimators': 100}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = train(X_smote, y_smote, 'classification', 'gradient_boosting', learning_rate = 0.05, max_depth=3, max_features='sqrt', n_estimators=100)\ny_pred = validation_eval('classification', model,  X_val, y_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny_pred = evaluate_test('classification', model, X_test, y_test)\n\n\nClassification Report:               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n        High       0.60      0.86      0.71        14\n         Low       0.67      0.91      0.77        22\n      Medium       0.92      0.72      0.81        65\n\n    accuracy                           0.78       101\n   macro avg       0.73      0.83      0.76       101\nweighted avg       0.82      0.78      0.79       101\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfeature_importances = model.feature_importances_\nfeature_names = X.columns\n\nimportance_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': feature_names, 'Importance': feature_importances}).sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False).head(15)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nimportance_df.plot(kind='barh', x='Feature', y='Importance', legend=False)\nplt.xlabel('Importance')\nplt.title('Top 15 Features')\nplt.show()\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 1000x600 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult Examining the recall scores, this gradient boosting multiclass classification model successfully predicts 86% of schools with high college persistence, 72% of schools with medium college persistence, and 91% of schools with low college persistence. While there is room for improvement in predicting the medium category, the model’s ability to accurately identify schools with low college persistence is particularly significant, as this is where where intervention is most needed. This model performed better than the Random Forest Classifier\nLooking at the feature importance, as seen in the regression on chronic absenteeism model, Average Grade 8 Proficiency is the most important driver of college persistence. It is noteworthy that this metric continues to have predictive power at the college level. Additionally, both dropout rate and the percentage of chronically absent students are significant features in this model, highlighting the deep-rooted issues within schools that must be addressed.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe results across all models provide consistent and valuable insights into the factors driving student outcomes such as chronic absenteeism, dropout risk, and college persistence in high schools. Key predictors include Average Grade 8 Proficiency, Supportive Environment score, and Rigorous Instruction score were found in multiple models, showing the importance of academic foundations, school culture, and quality instruction. Socioeconomic indicators, such as the Percent of Students in Temporary Housing, Percent of English Language Learners, and Percent of Overage/Undercredited Students, further emphasize the impact of systemic challenges on educational outcomes.\nModel Summary: * Regression: LASSO performed best, with a 61% fit and outperforming Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. * Binary Classification: The Gradient Boosting model effectively identified 91% of schools with high dropout risk. * Multiclass Classification: The Gradient Boosting multiclass model accurately predicted 86% of schools with high college persistence and 91% of schools with low college persistence, where intervention is most critical. * Note: Random Forest models showed slight improvements with tuning, but underperformed compared to Gradient Bosting.\nIn conclusion, these results highlight actionable insights for improving student outcomes. Initiatives need to strengthen academic foundations in early education, foster supportive school environments, and address socioeconomic challenges. Models with strong recall, can serve as valuable tools for identifying schools in need of intervention and targeting resources where they are most needed."

This file provided ZIP codes, which enabled me to join the quality data with Census data.\nDownload the mapping file"

    "text": "Takeaways\n\nSummary\nThis section focuses on collecting and integrating data to build a comprehensive dataset that explores the factors influencing negative high school outcomes in New York City. Using data from NYC InfoHub and Census mapping, I was able to create a unified and actionable dataset that will provides insights for improving educational equity and student success. This foundational work enables deeper analysis to inform strategies and interventions for better high school outcomes.\n\n\nChallenges\nOne major challenge I faced was finding data that could be aggregated into my dataset. The NYC high school quality data is organized by school name and DBN, a unique New York identifier that combines the district, borough, and NYC DOE school number. However, many other datasets, such as nationwide ones that I was interested in, did not include these identifiers, as they are specific to New York. As a result, I had to spend considerable time finding data with compatible aggregations, which somewhat limited my options. Eventually, I was able to find a mapping of DBN to ZIP code, which allowed me to incorporate census data into my school data, adding a few socioeconomic factors.\nFor future work, I would be interested in scaling this project to include all of New York State or even nationwide data. Currently, my analysis is limited to New York City high schools, resulting in a dataset of only about 500 rows, which is relatively small. Expanding to a larger dataset with more schools would likely enable the creation of more robust datasets and models.\n\n\nConclusion and Future Steps\nBy aggregating data from three different datasets, a comprehensive dataset is created to evaluate various features that may impact our target variables. This analysis helps us better understand how high school quality and socioeconomic factors influence high school outcomes in New York City. Next steps involve cleaning and exploring this data in order to prepare it for the modeling phase."

    "text": "The data cleaning phase is a crucial and often time-consuming part of any machine learning project. The dataset I am working with contains over 600 columns, which need to be narrowed down to the most relevant ones for analysis. Preparing the data carefully is essential for successful exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling. During the process, new issues often arise, particularly when working with large datasets where it’s impossible to anticipate every challenge upfront. This is why data cleaning is considered an iterative process that evolves as the project progresses.\nTo ensure the data is cleaned accurately, I relied on the NYC Public Schools’ School Quality Reports Educator Guide: High Schools 2022–231 as a data dictionary. This guide helped me understand the meaning behind many of the columns, allowing me to clean and organize the data effectively for future analysis.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder\nfrom sodapy import Socrata\nfrom scipy.stats import skew\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\npd.set_option('future.no_silent_downcasting', True)\n\nRead in data\n\nquality_tabs = pd.read_excel('../../data/raw-data/202223-hs-sqr-results.xlsx', skiprows=3, nrows=506, sheet_name=None)\nACS_df = pd.read_csv('../../data/raw-data/ACS_data.csv')\ndropout_df = pd.read_csv('../../data/raw-data/dropout_data.csv', index_col=None)\nmapping_df = pd.read_csv('../../data/mapping/2021_DOE_High_School_Directory.csv', index_col=None)\n\nConcat 4 dicts of quality sheets, remove first row, drop duplicated columns\n\ndf_quality = pd.concat(quality_tabs.values(), axis=1)\n\ndf_quality = df_quality.iloc[1: , :]\n\ndf_quality = df_quality.loc[:, ~df_quality.T.duplicated(keep='first')]\n\nGet columns needed from mapping, add zip code to df\n\n#get columns \ndf_mapping = mapping_df[['dbn','postcode']]\ndf_mapping.rename(columns={\"dbn\": \"DBN\", \"postcode\": \"zip code\"}, inplace=True)\n#add zip code to df\ndf = df_quality.merge(df_mapping, on='DBN', how='left')\n\nFind missing zip codes and export as csv\n\nmissing_school_zips = df.loc[df['zip code'].isna()]\nmissing_school_zips[['DBN', 'School Name']].drop_duplicates().to_csv('../../data/mapping/missing_list.csv', index=False)\n\nManually impute zip codes and read back in filled df\n\nmap2 = pd.read_csv('../../data/mapping/missing_list_labeled.csv')\n\nMerge again and fill in missing zip codes\n\ndf = df.merge(map2, on='DBN', how='left')\ndf['zip code'] = df['zip code'].fillna(df['zipcode1'])\ndf.drop(columns=['school_name1', 'zipcode1'],inplace=True)\n\nAdd in ACS data\n\nACS_df['zip code tabulation area'] = pd.to_numeric(ACS_df['zip code tabulation area'])\nACS_df.rename(columns={\"zip code tabulation area\": \"zip code\"}, inplace=True)\ndf = df.merge(ACS_df, on='zip code', how='left')\n\nClean the columns needed from dropout df, filter for 2018 cohort year -

This step significantly reduced the size of the dataframe by eliminating over 100 columns that wouldn’t have contributed meaningfully to the analysis due to the high volume of missing values. Next, I focused on imputing data for columns with less than 10% missing values. For imputation, I used the skew of the distribution to determine the best method. If the skew was greater than an absolute value of 0.5, I imputed using the median, as this is more robust to outliers. If the distribution appeared to be approximately normal, I used the mean for imputation. Finally, I removed the remaining three columns with missing data that did not meet the threshold, ensuring a complete and clean dataset for analysis.\n\nlen(df.columns)\n\n71\n\n\n\ndef handle_missingness(df, threshold=0.1):\n    \"\"\"Function for imputing data using skew when missingness &lt; 10% and removing columns with missingness &gt; 50% \"\"\"\n    for col in df.columns:\n        missingness = df[col].isna().sum() / len(df)\n        if missingness &lt; 0.1:\n            if df[col].dtype == 'float64':\n                col_skew = skew(df[col].dropna()) \n                if abs(col_skew) &gt; 0.5:\n                    df[col] = df[col].fillna(df[col].median())\n                else: \n                    df[col] = df[col].fillna(df[col].mean())\n            elif df[col].dtype == 'object':\n                df[col] = df[col].fillna(df[col].mode()[0]) \n        elif missingness &gt; 0.5:\n            df.drop([col], axis=1, inplace=True)\n    return df\n\n\ndf = handle_missingness(df)\n\nCheck null count of each column\n\ndf.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(20)\n\nMetric Value - Average score of students in the current cohort who took the SAT Reading and Writing exam    76\nMetric Value - Average score of students in the current cohort who took the SAT Math exam                   76\nStudent Achievement - Section Score                                                                         72\nMetric Value - Average Completion Rate for Remaining Regents                                                52\nPercent Male                                                                                                 0\nPercent Female                                                                                               0\nPercent English Language Learners                                                                            0\nPercent Students with IEPs                                                                                   0\nEconomic Need Index                                                                                          0\nPercent Neither Female nor Male                                                                              0\nDBN                                                                                                          0\nPercent in Temp Housing                                                                                      0\nPercent Overage / Undercredited                                                                              0\nPercent HRA Eligible                                                                                         0\nTeacher Percent - White                                                                                      0\nPercentage of Students Enrolled in an Advanced Math or Science Course                                        0\nPercentage of Students Enrolled in a College Credited Course                                                 0\nNearby Student Distance (mi)                                                                                 0\nPercentage of Students Enrolled in an AP Course                                                              0\nYears of principal experience at this school                                                                 0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nDrop remaining columns with missingness\n\ndf = df.drop(columns=['Metric Value - Average score of students in the current cohort who took the SAT Reading and Writing exam','Metric Value - Average score of students in the current cohort who took the SAT Math exam','Student Achievement - Section Score','Metric Value - Average Completion Rate for Remaining Regents'], axis=1)\n\nPost cleaning data check\n\ndf.dtypes.value_counts()\n\nfloat64    51\nobject      4\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\nThe remaining object columns are ‘DBN’, ‘School Name’, ‘District’, and ‘Borough’.

I decided to drop columns that were too granular, such as specific course types and certain demographic data, which were not directly relevant to my analysis. Additionally, some metric columns contained redundant information already captured by the ‘Metric Value’ columns I kept. As a result, I removed the N count, metric rating, metric score, comparison group, and positive response columns. After this filtering process, the dataset is now streamlined, containing 55 columns and 501 rows, ensuring a more focused and manageable analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Looking at the graph, it appears that high median income is associated with low dropout rates.

For example, I applied log transformations to variables exhibiting power law distributions, resulted in more normally distributed data, a key assumption for regression analysis.\nI also identified significant relationships between several variables and our target metrics. T-tests showed significant differences in median household income between schools with high and low dropout rates, as well as significant differences in supportive school environment scores between schools with high and low chronic absenteeism. Similarly, the ANOVA test revealed that the there is a significant difference in Economic Need Index for schools with different levels of college persistence. These findings all highlighting the importance of addressing socioeconomic and school quality factors to improve student outcomes.\nGeographic analysis further identified areas where intervention may be necessary, such as high dropout rates in the Bronx and high chronic absenteeism in district 84.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nData Preprocessing for Modeling: Apply transformations and drop multicollinear features that were identified using correlation heatmap.\nModeling: Develop regression models to predict chronic absenteeism and classification models to identify schools with high dropout rate and low college persistence rates.\nInvestigate additional transformations or feature engineering that can improve model performance.\n\nThese findings highlight the necessity to design targeted interventions in districts with high dropout rates or chronic absenteeism, focusing on socioeconomic factors and school environment. The goal is to build predictive models that can help inform these interventions to improve high school outcomes in New York City."

    "section": "Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction",
    "text": "Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction\n\nPCA\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised learning technique used for dimensionality reduction. It applies linear transformations to find the most important features, or principal components. It is a great technique to use if you have many dimensions and need a way to visualize them in 2 dimensions. It is also a good preprocessing technique to apple before supervised learning algorithms. The goal of PCA is to capture as much of the variance contained in the data as possible but in reduced dimensions. An important hyperparameter to tune is n_components, which specifies how many prinicipal components you want to retain.\nIn this case, we will apply PCA to our socioeconomic features to explore potential patterns and reduce the dimensionality of the data.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans, DBSCAN, AgglomerativeClustering, SpectralClustering\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf = pd.read_csv('../../data/processed-data/processed_df.csv', index_col=None)\n\n\nI will specify a subset of the socioeconomic factors in our dataframe\n\n\nCode\necon_subset = df[[\"Percent HRA Eligible\",\n    \"Percent in Temp Housing\",\n    \"Percent Overage / Undercredited\",\n    \"Economic Need Index\",\n    'Percent No High School (25+)',\n    \"Percent Bachelor's Degree or Higher (25+)\",\n    'Percent Language Other Than English at Home',\n    'Percent Population with Disabilities',\n    'Percent Foreign-Born Population',\n    'Percent Households with Broadband Internet',\n    'Median Household Income',\n    'Percent Households on SNAP/Food Stamps', 'dropout_rate','Percent of Students Chronically Absent','Metric Value - College Persistence']]\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_clean = df.drop(columns=['DBN','zip code','School Name','Borough'],axis=1)\n\n\nPCA is sensitive to variance in features of the dataset, so it is necessary to make sure that all our features are on the same scale. This can be achieved using sklean StandardScaler. In addition, it is also necessary to take the log of dropout rate so that it is normally distributed.\n\n\nCode\ndropout_rate = np.log(econ_subset['dropout_rate']+1) \n\nX_features = econ_subset.drop(columns=['Percent of Students Chronically Absent','dropout_rate','Metric Value - College Persistence'], axis=1)\n\n# Scale the features\nX_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_features)\n\n\nNow we can fit our PCA and visualize the first two components\n\n\nCode\npca = PCA(n_components=10) \nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)\n\nplt.plot(np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_), marker='o')\nplt.xlabel(\"number of components\")\nplt.ylabel(\"cumulative explained variance\")\nplt.show()\n\n#visualize the first two components\nplt.scatter(X_pca[:,0], X_pca[:,1], c=dropout_rate, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.7)\nplt.xlabel('PC-1')\nplt.ylabel('PC-2')\nplt.title('Principal Component Analysis')\nplt.colorbar(label='Dropout Rate')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npca = PCA(n_components=3) \nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)\n\n\nResults: From the first plot, it is possible to visualize the optimal number of components by examining the cumulative variance explained by additional components. According to this graph, three components appear to be the optimal amount, as the additional variance explained diminishes after that point. The first two components account for about 70% of the variance. Although distinct clusters are not evident from the first two principal components, it can be observed that schools with higher dropout rates tend to be positioned toward the top of the plot, while schools with lower dropout rates are located toward the bottom. This suggests a relationship between the principal components and dropout rates, even if the clusters are not clearly defined. This may indicate a need to use a non-linear algorithm to uncover better relationships in the data. Next, t-SNE can be used to determine if more distinct relationships emerge.\n\n\nt-SNE\nt-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is an unsupervised learning technique used for dimensionality reduction. It is effective for high-dimensional data and is preferred over linear methods like PCA when the data has non-linear relationships. It is a great tool for visualizing high dimensional data in 2D. The important hyperparameter here is perplexity, which controls the balance between local and global structure. At a high preplexity, t-SNE preseves global structure and results in more generalized clusters, while a lower perplexity emphasizes local structure and may be able to identify smaller distinct patterns.\nIn this analysis, t-SNE will be applied to the entire dataset to explore how its clustering behavior can help visualize and understand the relationship between school and socioeconomic characteristics and college persistence.\n\n\nCode\n#specify target to color graph by\ncollege_persistence = df_clean['Metric Value - College Persistence']\n\n# drop target column\nX_features = df_clean.drop(['Metric Value - College Persistence'], axis=1)\n\n# scale\nX_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df_clean)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=5)\nX_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X_scaled)\n\nplt.scatter(X_tsne[:,0], X_tsne[:,1], c=college_persistence, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.7)\nplt.xlabel('t-SNE 1')\nplt.ylabel('t-SNE 2')\nplt.title('t-SNE results')\nplt.colorbar(label='College Persistence')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also try a higher perplexity value, which focuses more on global structure rather than local structure\n\n\nCode\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=50)\nX_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X_scaled)\n\nplt.scatter(X_tsne[:,0], X_tsne[:,1], c=college_persistence, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.7)\nplt.xlabel('t-SNE 1')\nplt.ylabel('t-SNE 2')\nplt.title('t-SNE results')\nplt.colorbar(label='College Persistence')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults: Although clearly defined and separable clusters are not present, at a low perplexity, one can observe some distinct groupings of schools represented by lighter green and yellow dots, indicating that these schools have high college persistence. Conversely, darker purple clusters represent schools with lower college persistence. In the second graph, where the perplexity is set to 50, the clusters are less clearly separable. However, a noticeable pattern emerges, with high college persistence schools appearing towards the bottom and those with lower college persistence positioned towards the top. From this, one can conclude that t-SNE is able to uncover certain patterns in the data, helping to differentiate schools with varying levels of college persistence, even if the clusters are not perfectly defined.\n\nPCA vs. t-SNE\nBoth of these dimensionality reduction techniques are useful for reducing and visualizing high dimensional data. PCA is preferred for data with linear relationships because it is able to capture the maximum variance through few principal components. On the other hand, t-SNE is better for visualizing non-linear relationships. Depending on the perplexity, t-SNE may preserve local structure at low values and be able to uncover small clusters and relationships. However, this can be tricky if you are interested in interpretting it at the global level. In this case, using t-SNE with a low perplexity successfully grouped schools with similar outcomes, uncovering relationships that were less apparent in both PCA and t-SNE with higher perplexity. Given the small dataset, it appears that t-SNE was able to detect meaningful patterns where larger clusters were not present, revealing some of the underlying relationships between the schools.\n\n\n\nK-means Clustering\nK-means is an unsupervised learning technique used for clustering. The goal is to group data points into distinct clusters. It does this by assigning each point to the nearest cluster center with the goal of minimizing the within-cluster variance.\nTo determine the optimal number of clusters, one can use the elbow method. The elbow method involved plotting the inertia and looking for the “elbow” of the graph, where the reduction in intertia starts to slow down. This is an important way to choose an optimal number of clusters becasue after this point, there is diminishing returns in reducing intertia and adding more clusters.\nThe goal of K-means clustering is: 1. Maximize inter-cluster distance: distance between clusters, high distance means high separation 2. Minimize intra-cluster distance: distance of points in cluster to the center, low distance means high cohesion.\nClusters can be evaluated with a silhouette score. A higher score indicates more well defined clusters.\nK-means clustering will be performed on our data of socioeconomic factors that was reduced with PCA.\n\n\nCode\ninertia = []\nk_values = range(1, 30)\n\nfor k in k_values:\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)\n    kmeans.fit(X_pca)\n    inertia.append(kmeans.inertia_)\n\nplt.plot(k_values, inertia, marker='o')\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Clusters (K)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Inertia\")\nplt.title(\"Elbow Method to Choose K\")\nplt.xticks(k_values)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the optimal number of clusters is about 4.\n\n\nCode\nn_clusters = 4\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters)\necon_clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X_pca)\n\nfor cluster in range(n_clusters):\n    plt.scatter(X_pca[econ_clusters == cluster, 0], X_pca[econ_clusters == cluster, 1],\n        label=f\"Cluster {cluster + 1}\", s=50, alpha=0.6)\n\nplt.xlabel(\"PCA 1\")\nplt.ylabel(\"PCA 2\")\nplt.title(\"K-means Clustering of Socioeconomic Factors\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK-means cluster labels can be used to view the means of each variable in the clusters and gauge the clustering performance\n\n\nCode\necon_df = econ_subset.copy()\necon_df['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_\n\nclusters = econ_df.groupby('Cluster').mean()\nclusters.round(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent HRA Eligible\nPercent in Temp Housing\nPercent Overage / Undercredited\nEconomic Need Index\nPercent No High School (25+)\nPercent Bachelor's Degree or Higher (25+)\nPercent Language Other Than English at Home\nPercent Population with Disabilities\nPercent Foreign-Born Population\nPercent Households with Broadband Internet\nMedian Household Income\nPercent Households on SNAP/Food Stamps\ndropout_rate\nPercent of Students Chronically Absent\nMetric Value - College Persistence\n\n\nCluster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.81\n0.18\n0.07\n0.75\n0.15\n0.21\n0.60\n0.16\n0.34\n0.81\n41433.45\n0.40\n0.07\n0.44\n0.41\n\n\n1\n0.56\n0.07\n0.03\n0.64\n0.10\n0.39\n0.58\n0.11\n0.46\n0.88\n76731.99\n0.19\n0.03\n0.32\n0.64\n\n\n2\n0.62\n0.11\n0.05\n0.69\n0.02\n0.78\n0.25\n0.08\n0.23\n0.94\n154196.88\n0.06\n0.04\n0.43\n0.54\n\n\n3\n0.73\n0.13\n0.06\n0.80\n0.07\n0.38\n0.36\n0.11\n0.32\n0.87\n77204.32\n0.20\n0.06\n0.45\n0.43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nprint(f'Silhouette Score: {silhouette_score(X_pca, kmeans.labels_)}')\n\n\nSilhouette Score: 0.3276664537712163\n\n\nResults: Taking a closer look at the clusters, cluster 0 stands out with the highest dropout rate, highest percent of student who are chronically absent, and lowest college persistence rate. The cluster is also associated with several socioeconomic challenges, including the highest percentage of students elgibile for public assistance from the NYC Human Resources Administration (HRA)1, a high Economic Need Index, the lowest percentage of people with a Bachelor’s degree or higher, highest percentage of individuals with disabilities, lowest median household income, and highest percentage of households on food stamps.\nIt is evident that the K-means clustering is able to effectively find groupings of schools based on socioeconomic factors. This emphasizes that these features are significant predictors of poor high school outcomes. However, as shown by the plot and our silhouette score, there is limited separation between our clusters and some overlap exists. This suggets that our current approach may not fully capture the complexity of the data, and may need to use alternate non-linear algorithms for clustering."

It is effective for identifying clusters in data with irregular, non-linear relationships. Unlike other clustering algorithms, DBSCAN can detect outliers by identifying points that do not fit well into any cluster and labels them as noise.\nThe important hyperparameters are epsilon, the maximum distance between two samples from them to be considered in the same cluster, and min points, the minimum number of points required to form a dense region.

    "text": "Hierarchical Clustering\nHierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that builds a tree-like structure of clusters to organize our data. It does this in two ways: - Agglomerative: A bottom up approach where each observation starts as its own cluster and is merged with others as it moves up the hierarchy - Divisive: A top down approach where all data points start in one cluster, and are split recursively as you go down the hierarchy\nThe agglomerative approach is more commonly used, so I will apply this method to the PCA-reduced data. Unlike kmeans, hierarchical clustering doesn’t require us to specify a k number of clusters. It can be more flexible. We will visualize it with a dendogram to show insights into its structure.\n\n\nCode\nopt_labels=maximize_silhouette(X_pca,algo=\"ag\",nmax=15, i_plot=True)\n\nscatter = plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=opt_labels, cmap='viridis')\nplt.xlabel(\"PCA 1\")\nplt.ylabel(\"PCA 2\")\nplt.title(\"Agglomerative Clustering after PCA\")\nplt.legend(*scatter.legend_elements(), title=\"Clusters\")\nplt.show()\n\nprint(f\"Silhouette Score: {silhouette_score(X_pca, opt_labels)}\")\n\n\n(501, 2)\nOPTIMAL PARAMETER = 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSilhouette Score: 0.5769711294126749\n\n\nNow I can add clusters back to dataframe and visualize how the target variables appear in each cluster\n\n\nCode\ndf_subset['Agglomerative_Cluster'] = opt_labels\n\ndf_subset['dropout'] = np.exp(df_subset['log_dropout_rate']) - 1\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))\nsns.boxplot(data=df_subset, x='Agglomerative_Cluster', y='Percent of Students Chronically Absent', ax=axes[0])\nsns.boxplot(data=df_subset, x='Agglomerative_Cluster', y='Metric Value - College Persistence', ax=axes[1])\nsns.boxplot(data=df_subset, x='Agglomerative_Cluster', y='dropout', ax=axes[2])\n\naxes[0].set_title('Chronic Absenteeism')\naxes[1].set_title('College Persistence')\naxes[2].set_title('Dropout Rate')\n\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Percentage of Students Chronically Absent')\naxes[1].set_ylabel('College Persistence')\naxes[2].set_ylabel('Dropout Rate')\n\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Agglomerative Cluster')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Agglomerative Cluster')\naxes[2].set_xlabel('Agglomerative Cluster')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nCode\nZ = linkage(X_pca, 'ward')\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))\ndendrogram(Z, truncate_mode='level', p=10)\nplt.title('Dendrogram for Agglomerative Clustering')\nplt.xlabel('Data points')\nplt.ylabel('Distance')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults: The Agglomerative Clustering algorithm achieved the highest silhouette score among the clustering methods tested. In addition, it is clear that Cluster 1 contains schools with the best student outcomes, with the lowest chronic absenteeism, lowest dropout rates, and highest college persistence. This indicates that the algorithm successfully identified meaningful patterns in the data, emphasizing the impact of these features on school outcomes. By examining the qualities and socioeconomic factors associated with the schools in this cluster, one can gain insights into the key drivers of success in these public high schools. In addition, the dendogram helps us visualize how the schools are grouped at different levels of similarity and the hierarchical relationships between them.\n\nConclusion\nI applied various clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods, and was able to identify key patterns in the school data. PCA revealed that three components explained most of the variance, with a relationship between dropout rates and principal components. t-SNE uncovered distinct groups of schools based on college persistence at the local level but struggled with global separation at higher perplexity values.\nK-means clustering was able to highlight schools with socioeconomic challenges but was not able to clearly separate the clusters. After tuning DBSCAN, I saw a bit better separability, but most schools were in one large cluster. Agglomerative Clustering, had the highest silhouette score, and was able to identify schools with the best outcomes, shown by the our targets like chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence. The dendrogram also provided insight into the hierarchical relationships between schools.\nOverall, Agglomerative Clustering provided the most meaningful insights, emphasizing the ability of my features to predict school success."

    "text": "Motivation:\nDropping out of high school has often been linked to many long term negative outcomes. Research shows that students who drop out of high school are more likely to face unemployment, earn lower wages, engage in high-risk behaviors, become incarcerated, and impose significant costs on society1. Through this website, I aim to explore the factors that potentially contribute to high school dropout rates, with the goal of identifying opportunities for early intervention to mitigate these negative outcomes. Particularly, I wanted to look at how these metrics manifest in New York City public schools. My focus will be on understanding how school quality and socioeconomic factors influence student outcomes, specifically chronic absenteeism (missing more than 10% of the school year), dropout rates, and college persistence (returning to college after the first year).\nThis research is intended to inform policymakers, researchers, and data enthusiasts interested in understanding the factors that contribute to chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence. I hypothesize that these three outcomes are interconnected. For instance, high chronic absenteeism may correlate with higher dropout rates, and even if students avoid dropping out of high school, could there still be a risk of low college persistence? These are the key questions I aim to address through this research.\n\nData Science Questions:\n\nHow does a school’s environment contribute to better student outcomes?\nWhat are the most significant predictors of student absenteeism, dropout rates and college persistence?\nWhat are the interactions between chronic absenteeism, dropout rates, and college persistence?\nHow does socioeconomic status impact student absenteeism, dropout rates and college persistence?\nHow can early academic indicators be used to identify schools at risk of high dropout or not persisting in college?\n\n\n\nRelevant Current Research\nSchool building condition, school attendance, and academic achievement in New York City public schools: A mediation model: This study, published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology in 2008, examined the relationship between school building condition and the academic achievement of students in elementary schools in Manhattan, New York City. The researchers found that school building condition was positively related to student achievement in mathematics and English Language Arts. They also found that attendance important to this relationship, suggesting that students in better-quality buildings are more likely to attend school, which in turn leads to better academic outcomes.2\nA Public Health Perspective on School Dropout and Adult Outcomes: A Prospective Study of Risk and Protective Factors from Age 5 to 27: This research paper investigates the long-term consequences of high school dropout, framing it as a significant public health issue. A study followed 585 individuals from age 5 to 27, analyzing the correlation between dropping out and negative outcomes like unemployment, arrest, and poor health, finding a strong link between them. The researchers identified several risk and protective factors, such as low socioeconomic status at age 5 and peer rejection in elementary school. The findings highlight the importance of early intervention and suggest that addressing school dropout proactively could significantly improve individual lives and reduce societal costs.1\nNeighborhood Poverty and Public Policy: A 5-Year Follow-Up of Children’s Educational Outcomes in the New York City Moving to Opportunity Demonstration: This research paper analyzes the long-term effects of the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program, an experiment that provided housing vouchers to low-income families in high-poverty neighborhoods to relocate to lower-poverty areas. The study focuses on a subset of New York City children followed for five years, comparing their educational outcomes with those who remained in high-poverty neighborhoods. The results revealed negative effects on grades and school engagement for both boys and girls in low-poverty neighborhoods. The study highlights the necessity of improving educational outcomes for low-income minority children, focusing on family, neighborhood, housing, and school factors.3\n\n\nNext Steps\nThis website offers data driven insights, visualizations, and machine learning models to dive into this topic.
